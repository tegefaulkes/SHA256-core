so, to verify that testing works run the command
"sbt 'testOnly gcd.GCDTester -- -z Basic'"
within the main directory.


The main test function is fully working to spec and I tested it against an online SHA256 Hasher.

testing takes the form
sbt 'test:runMain sha256.testMessageScheduler'
in console.
